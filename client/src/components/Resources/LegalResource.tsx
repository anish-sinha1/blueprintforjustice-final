              In pursuing legal action, it is important to document everything
              before beginning to ask questions; for example, a document from
              the FBI could provide insight into how police reports are written
              to best communicate. Documenting the events that have occurred
              allows for faster communication and processing.

              There are major differences in criminal and civil cases that are
              important to know. According to the Department of Justice,
              criminal cases are investigated and handled separately from civil
              cases, even if they concern the same incident. In a criminal case,
              the government brings a case against the accused person. In a
              civil case, the case is brought against a governmental authority
              or law enforcement agency. The evidence in a criminal case must
              establish proof "beyond a reasonable doubt," while in civil cases,
              the proof only needs to satisfy the lower standard of a
              "preponderance of the evidence." Finally, in criminal cases, the
              Department's goal is to bring justice to an alleged wrongdoer by
              sending them to prison or other consequences. While in civil
              cases,the Department's goal is to correct a law enforcement
              agency's policies and practices that have been found to lead to
              misconduct.
