              Taking care of yourself is crucial to the healing process.
              Remember that you deserve to be seen, heard, and understood. Your
              feelings and emotions are valid. There are many resources and
              organizations available to support you in processing your trauma
              and emotions. <em>What does self care look like?</em>: Self-care
              looks differently for everybody. For some people, it looks like
              therapy, exercising, or journaling. For others, maybe it's crying,
              praying, spending time with friends and family, or joining a
              community organization. Read below to learn more about how the
              Mothers of the Movement created space for healing in their
              communities.

              , led by Reverend Wanda Johnson, emphasizes the need for
              destigmatizing mental health within the Black community. Through
              their Healing Hurting Hearts program, the organization hosts
              monthly support sessions for mothers whose children died from gun
              violence. The organization also recognizes that while the murder
              of innocent black men and women impacts the families, trauma from
              the incident affects the entire community. They approach this
              issue by focusing on the grieving process.
