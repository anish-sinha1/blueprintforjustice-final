### Reverse Proxy service for Blueprint For Justice

This directory contains a **development** configuration for nginx and assumes you are using docker. If you are not, replace all instances of `host.docker.internal` with `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. A production configuration would require you to acquire SSL certificates and a strong dhparam key. However, this configuration works great for development.
